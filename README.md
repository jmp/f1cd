# f1cd

A simple countdown timer for Formula 1Â® sessions.

## testing

    npm test

## building

    npm run build

This creates a bundle at `dist/index.js` and copies
`index.html` from the root directory to the same same
directory. The contents of `dist` can then be deployed
anywhere as a static website.

## demo

The app is deployed to https://f1cd.netlify.app 
from the `master` branch.
